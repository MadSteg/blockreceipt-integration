# 🚀 BlockReceipt Integration Hub

## 📋 **Project Overview**
This repository serves as the integration hub between Cursor development and Replit visualization.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Cursor (Development Backend):**
- `blockreceipt-pre/` - Core backend services
- `blockreceipt-mobile/` - Mobile app development
- `blockreceipt-frontend/` - Frontend components
- All AI development, testing, and validation

### **Replit (Visualization Frontend):**
- Live preview of all developed components
- Integration testing environment
- User interface development
- Final product deployment at `blockreceipt.ai`

## 🔄 **Integration Workflow**

### **Development Process:**
1. **Develop in Cursor** - All code, AI assistance, debugging
2. **Test in Cursor** - Validate functionality locally
3. **Push to Integration** - Sync changes to this repo
4. **Deploy to Replit** - Visualize and test integration
5. **Iterate** - Refine based on Replit visualization
